## What is this?

This is a command-line tool designed to automatically watch Twitch streams and claim Time-Based Drops for a selected game.

It runs in the background, finds eligible streams, simulates watch time by sending the necessary $\text{GQL}$ events, and automatically claims drops as they become available.

### How it Works

1. Logs into your Twitch account (saves credentials to `data/save.json`).
2. Fetches active Drop Campaigns and **groups them by game** to ask you to select one.
3. Finds and prioritizes the **best eligible live stream** for that campaign.
4. Simulates "watching" that stream. **Note:** The underlying $\text{GQL}$ implementation is powered by [**twitch-gql-rs**](https://github.com/this-is-really/twitch-gql-rs).
5. Monitors your drop progress with a **real-time terminal progress bar**.
6. **Automatically claims** the drop once the required time is met, with robust retry logic.
7. Saves claimed drops to `data/cash.json` to avoid re-claiming.

## üíª Available Binaries

Standard pre-compiled binaries are provided for common platforms.

* **Windows:** Executable for **x86\_64** architecture (**$\text{.exe}$** file).
* **Linux:** **$\text{ELF}$** executable for **x86\_64** architecture.

## üêû Found a Bug?

Bugs were common during the Alpha stage, but this **Beta release is significantly more stable**. We've fixed most critical issues, and you might have to try hard now to find the remaining errors.

If you still encounter *any* crashes, errors, or unexpected behavior, please **open an Issue** in this repository.
