## What is this?

This is a command-line tool designed to automatically watch Twitch streams and claim Time-Based Drops for a selected game.

It runs in the background, finds eligible streams, simulates watch time by sending the necessary GQL events, and automatically claims drops as they become available.

### How it Works (Theoretically)

1. Logs into your Twitch account (saves credentials to `data/save.json`).
2. Fetches active Drop Campaigns and asks you to select a game.
3. Finds an eligible live stream for that campaign.
4. Simulates "watching" that stream. **Note:** The underlying $\text{GQL}$ implementation is powered by [**twitch-gql-rs**](https://github.com/this-is-really/twitch-gql-rs)
5. Monitors your drop progress with a terminal progress bar.
6. Automatically claims the drop once the required time is met.
7. Saves claimed drops to `data/cash.json` to avoid re-claiming.
